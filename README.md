# U-NET-Image-Segmentation
Practical use case of U-NET model for Segmentation of Images to detect Oil leakge



# Dataset and model
Analysing the training dataset is found that there are 790 SAR images along with their respective mask.
In order to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect Oil Seeps, I selected U-NET Image segmentation
model. In order to do segmentation of an image, It is very important to understand labels at pixel-level.
