# U-NET-Image-Segmentation
Practical use case of U-NET model for Segmentation of Images to detect Oil leakage or Seep detection.
This is very famous problem statement in Induatrial and Manufacturing sector where Machine Learning especially 
Computer Vision concept can be used to detect faults which are very hard to detect by normal human beings.



# Dataset and model
Analysing the training dataset, It is found that there are 790 SAR images along with their respective mask.
In order to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect Oil Seeps, I selected U-NET Image segmentation
model. In order to do segmentation of an image, It is very important to understand labels at pixel-level.
